Completed
    - Instead of loading a big picture of the whole map, you load in only 1 copy each unique tile
    - Added my own ".map" file format for loading a map, which will use the tile sheet to make the map

To do
    - Add basic warping
    - Add basic tile collision
    - Add certain tiles as special so they draw part of it on top of the player
