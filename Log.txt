A lot of the changes here are the same code apparently being deleted and readded - this may be due to cloning the repo, i'm not sure
but ignore some of the code changes shown, as its changing old code to the exact same code for the new bits :/

Completed
    - Centered player on screen, and moves map relative to player
    - Can still instantly teleport to any tile seamlessly if neccessary
    - Added sound files with 2 types of sounds
	1) background music - music which runs continuously (on a loop) until you choose to play another background music
	2) sound effects - play once when requested
    - Loads the sound files on a different Thread, and will play first music (Pallet town music) after all sounds are loaded
    - Fixed KeyInput.wasPressed() and KeyInput.wasReleased(), need to update the "keysLastTick" variable at end of tick not beginning

To do
    - Add animation to player movement
    - Add basic tile loading, rather than loading single image of map
    - Add basic tile collision
