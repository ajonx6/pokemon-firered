Completed
    - Added input with WASD
    - Added SpriteSheets (loads a sprite, and splits into equal sized pieces)
    - Added player sprites for each movement direction
    - Added basic map functionality (a name and sprite)
    - Added the pokemon tile movement 
        - Each frame it moves the amount of pixels needed to move 16
          pixels (size of the tile) in the given time (here, 0.4s)
        - At the end of the movement, as the position will most likely
          be 1 or 2 pixels out of place, we adjust to the exact position
          using these formulas:
	  1) pixelx = ((tilex + 0.5) * tilesize - spritewidth / 2)
	  2) pixely = ((tiley + 1.0) * tilesize - spriteheight + 1)

To do
    - Add animation to player movement
    - Center player on screen and move world behind player
